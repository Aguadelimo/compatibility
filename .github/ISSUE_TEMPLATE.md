- CPU backend:              <!-- As of today Vita3K uses two CPU backend engines to run games: Unicorn and Dynarmic.
                            When testing games Dynarmic should be prefered as it normally gives better results than Unicorn but 
                            if games dont't work in Dynarmic please test Unicorn as well. You can change the CPU backend on Settings -> CPU -> CPU backend
                            The following field should reflect which CPU backend you used to get the results you are reporting in this issue. -->
